Full Stack Project on Movie Recommendation System during my internship at CodXo!
This project involved building a recommendation system using content-based filtering techniques. 
It was a fantastic learning experience working on both the backend logic and frontend development, enhancing my skills in Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, and HTML/CSS.
